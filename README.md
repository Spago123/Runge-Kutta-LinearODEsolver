# Runge-Kutta-LinearODEsolver

The code in this repository represents an implementation of a numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations using Runge-Kutta 4th order metod. The code is written in C++ language. If you want to download the code and run it on your machine, you must install Eigen external library for matrix manipulations. For more infos about the metod see the file Runge-Kutta 4order in the repository.
